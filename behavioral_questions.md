### 1. What attracted you to our startup?

At first, I was attracted when see the JD, it matches about 90% my technical skills and experience: Flutter, Python, AI - which is very rare to me. The only thing different is the Google Cloud Platform experience, since I'm mostly work with AWS, but I believe the core concepts are transferable and I'm eager to learn. 

I didn't know much about your startup yet, to be honest. The info I know now is that the start up is an AI Edtech company, providing AI solutions for better education. Fortunately, both AI and education are areas I'm passionate about. My family have a tradition of working or do things related to education. My father and some of my relatives are teachers. For me, I often join or be invited as instructor or lecturer for company's internal training programs, and I enjoy it very much. When I worked as a Tech Lead at my old company, I didn't just providing technical decisions or solving problems, I also focused on developing my team's members, helping them to grow and improve their skills.

AI is a popular thing nowaday, but applying AI in some areas including education is still blue ocean. I'm looking forward to learn about your start up and contribute to its success.

### 2. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?

When the LLM wave started a few years ago, along with the economic downturn in the IT outsourcing industry, there are many doors had been closed while many new ones had opened. For a few months, I have been slow myself down a little and go take some courses, learn about other domains and areas, like business administration, marketing, try to build my own start from ground up... What I have learned so far is shaping my strategy and vision for the future.

In the next 5 years, given the landscape where LLMs and automated building tools like AI coding agents are getting better, I believe there will be more and more opportunities for professionals who can identify problems effectively, provide complete, sustainable and effective solutions, and leverage AI to enhance research, validation, as well as productivity and creativity in their work. My aim is to open my knowledge domains, train my mindset toward business and product thinking, while still sharpening my technical skills to stay relevant in this fast-changing landscape.

### 3. Why did you leave your previous jobs (if applicable)?

My previous company was a IT outsourcing company, which my team is a sub-brand of the mother company. I was the one who create development team, being the technical leader and driving force behind many successful projects. Although my sub-brand team was quite successful for a few years, the mother company was heavy and slow, from the top manager down to many teams couldn't escape the old tech stacks and processes, become slower and couldn't react to market changes. This created a financial and cultural crisis, affected the company's position, shrinked the shared sale and marketing team, and ultimately led to my team's downfall simply because there was no new projects coming in. Therefore I decided to leave and seek new opportunities where I could continue to grow and make an impact.

I believe that in a fast-paced industry like technology, it's crucial to be in an environment that fosters innovation and agility. I wanted to be part of a team that is not only keeping up with the latest trends but also setting them. I am excited about the potential to work in a more dynamic setting where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue to develop my skills.

### 4. How do you think education can be improved with technology and why? 

While I may need longer study and research to maybe give a better answers, but some new strong features of recent AI and connectivity technologies have the potential to greatly enhance education. For example, smart feedbacks just in time can help students understand their mistakes and learn from them more effectively, keeping the momentum. Or AI can create personalized learning experiences, adapting to each student's pace and style, detecting and helping them when they stuck, which create more engagement and motivation, reduce the stress.

While being promising, it's important to also consider the natures of learning and practicing. I really like this talk from Veritasium, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xS68sl2D70. While this age of AI is bringing many changes, it's not the first time we're expecting technology to revolutionize education. Whether it's traditional or AI-assisted, helping the learners be well trained, getting familiar and even proficient with the concepts takes time. I imagine AI can even detect and customize such effortful process for the learner, leading the way to more effective and efficient learning experiences.

### 5. If your friends or former employer were asked to comment on 3 good traits and 3 bad traits about you, what would they say and why?

Good traits:
1. Hard working: I am dedicated to putting in the time and effort required to achieve my goals and help my team succeed.
2. Eager to learn and explore: I actively seek out new knowledge, whether it's new tech stacks like new programming languages or frameworks, or even new domain like business or marketing.
3. Empathetic: While focusing on technical solutions, I actually value EQ, put myself in the teammates' or clients' shoes, understand the desires or challenges they are having. This help me a lot when leading the team or providing solutions to the customer, solving both technical and emotional needs.

Bad traits:
1. Introvert: While I always try to expand my knowledge, it's quite hard for me to quickly and initially engage in conversations with new people. It will take time for me to warm up, which sometimes becomes a barrier in networking or team interactions.
2. Difficulty to say no: I tend to take on too much responsibility at once, try to complete multiple tasks simultaneously, jumping from tasks to tasks and sometimes lead to burnout or mistakes.
3. Hard to express myself: I sometimes struggle to articulate my thoughts clearly, especially about non-technical matters, which can create weaker bonds with my teammates and hinder effective communication.

### 6. If you could buy a billboard anywhere around the world, what would it say and where would it be?

"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single plan". I learned the hard way that even learning requires a solid plan and direction. Without a clear roadmap, it's easy to get lost or overwhelmed. But people, including me, when learning something new will just start watching tutorials, following random resources without a clear goal, and finally fail and give up, going nowhere.

About the place, can I put it in Youtube ads? Does that count? You know because it's the first place people go to when they start learning new stuffs. They keep watching and watching, feel like learning, but actually no. There should be plan with short-term goals, milestones to track progress, time pressure. AI can help with that.

### 7. What do you believe is true, but can’t prove? 

I believe that the current education style of providing "structures", "steps" to solving problems is the wrong way to learn. I can't prove it with evidence or research, but it's from my personal experience. I used to hate math, a lot, but still love physics and chemistry. One day my friend, who studied in a math-focused gifted class, shared with me how they were taught to approach problems. Instead of given steps to solve pre-defined types of problems, like with Type 1 do these steps, type 2 do other steps, they were encouraged to explore the problems themselves, try what they think is right, and slowly develop the intuition and understanding needed to tackle a wide range of challenges.

That is when I realize, that how I learned English, Physics, and Chemistry, but not math or some other subjects. So if I will teach my son or daughter, I will encourage them to explore and understand the underlying concepts, rather than just memorizing steps or formulas.
